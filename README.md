# OT64-CPU


## Description 

The project consists of the creation of an encryption algorithm with a temporal dependence between the bytes and the moment when the algorithm was used.

The algorithm will be optimized only for processors with 64-bit operations.

## Advancement

For the moment nothing has been coded yet and only attempts to code in python have been made.

The first version will be entirely in python and made as experimental.


## code 

The code will be done mainly in python and C++ as well as a C++ API for python in order to be able to use the OT64 algorithm in python and other languages.


### extra

I'm a student with a lot of work but I promise to work on it at least 4 times a week and to produce a version in 1 month.

And the possibility of creating a blockchain based on the true philosophy of Satoshi Nakamoto is not zero (CPU only and anonymity in PoW)
