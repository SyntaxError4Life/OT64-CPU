# OT64-CPU


## Description 

The project consists of the creation of an encryption algorithm with a temporal dependence between the bytes and the moment when the algorithm was used.

The algorithm will be optimized only for processors with 64-bit operations like XOR gates and floating-point operations.

### The algorithm will encrypt by words (32 bits) with:

Salt as the start of the sequence to be encrypted which could be metadata on the data to be encrypted (date).

A key of multiple size of 32 bits which will encrypt word by word (allows keys of unlimited size).

## Advancement

Currently I am working on the theory and I see how to do it in python program, I have a version in preparation.

The first version will be entirely in python and made as experimental.


## code 

The code will be done mainly in python and C++ as well as a C++ API for python in order to be able to use the OT64 algorithm in python and other languages.


### extra

I'm a student with a lot of work but I promise to work on it at least 4 times a week and to produce a version in 1 month.

And the possibility of creating a blockchain based on the true philosophy of Satoshi Nakamoto is not zero (CPU only and anonymity in PoW)
