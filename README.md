# OT64-CPU

## Description 

The project consists of the creation of an encryption algorithm with a temporal dependence between the bytes and the moment when the algorithm was used.
The algorithm will be optimized only for processors with 64-bit operations.

## Table of contents :

- [Code](#code)


## code 

The code will be done mainly in python and C++ as well as a C++ API for python in order to be able to use the OT64 algorithm in python and other languages.
